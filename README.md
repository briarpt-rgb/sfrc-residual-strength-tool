SFRC Residual Flexural Strength Prediction App

This repository contains a Streamlit-based web application for predicting the residual flexural strengths $f_{R,1}$ and $f_{R,3}$ of steel-fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC).

The application implements the empirical prediction models proposed in the associated manuscript and provides design-oriented outputs by converting mean predictions into characteristic and design values using calibrated reliability-based scaling factors.
